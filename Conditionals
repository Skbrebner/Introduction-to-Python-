#we're compaing x to y. if x is less than y, then it will print the statement "st" X is less than Y". When you change it to x, y = 1000, 100, you come up with an error message that explains the local variable statement wasnt executed because x was > than y for this conditional. 
# So, we need to come up with a conditional statement that will add in the case where this is false. So the else condition makes "IN ALL OTHER CASES" print the alternative- being x is greater than y
# Python has what's called "conditional statements let you use "a if C else b" instead of the entire thing above. You can WRITE CONDITIONAL STATEMENTS IN ONE LINE.
