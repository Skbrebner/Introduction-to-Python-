# Python has build in methods for opening file objects. 
#You can open files, write data into them, add data onto the end, read the data back in
#TO start, you dont have to write in any imports. Python does it automatically.  
#Creates a variable named "F", then we're calling the function "open" to opean a "FILE NAME" called 
#textfile.txt. 

#The function 'Open' takes two arguements- the file name you want to open, and a 'string' representing
#the kinds of permissions, or operations, you want to do on the file. 'w' means write. + means create
#it if it doesnt exist. 

#First, we open the file ,
#Then, the second block of code shows us write some lines of data to the file and finished with a
#'close the file when done' 

#Then, you can open a txt file for writing also if you use "append access" (a) instead of "write" (w)
#When I open up a file for writing, I'm going to overwrite all the contents that are already in there. 
#If all I want to do is add stuff onto the end of the file, I use the append permission.

#10 lines of data that read "this is line ___" render 

#Then we must comment out the other openinig, reading, and writing of the files through other methods so that
#we can call 'open' to read the permission 

#calling the f.readlines() function is useful for reading each line into a list, then printing it out.
